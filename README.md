# MSAcademy

A website dedicated to all things **Minesweeper** — from strategy discussions and efficiency techniques to reviews of Minesweeper variants.  

This project is currently in its early stages. The initial focus is on building out a blog platform, but additional features are planned to expand its scope.

## Planned Features
- **Strategy Guides** – In-depth breakdowns of solving techniques and probability-based decision making.  
- **Game Reviews** – Analysis of different Minesweeper clones, variants, and related puzzle games.  
- **Interactive Tools** – Utilities to help players practice solving boards and improve efficiency.  
- **Community Content** – Space for player submissions, tips, and discussions.  

## Status
The blog is under active development. Core content publishing is the current priority, with interactive features coming in later iterations.  

Stay tuned for updates!
