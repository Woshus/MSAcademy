            <h2>About the Creator</h2>
            <p>
                This website was created by <strong>Woshus</strong>, a passionate Minesweeper player who first
                started exploring the game in January 2025. While initially playing casually, I began to take
                Minesweeper seriously in July 2025, focusing on efficiency and improving my solving strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey has been all about understanding the logic behind every click, learning how to
                optimize moves, and sharing those insights with the community. I started with basic boards,
                experimented with various approaches, and gradually honed a more analytical style of play.

                Full disclosure: I'm too lazy to essay so this website's text is mostly written with ChatGPT.

                Minesweeper Academy is meant to document my journey, share strategies, and provide resources
                for anyone looking to improve their Minesweeper skills — whether you're just starting or
                aiming to refine your efficiency like me.
