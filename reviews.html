            <h2> Step 2 </h2>

            <div class="two-img-step-box">
                <img src="images/08_19_25_170/step2_probs.png">
                <img src="images/08_19_25_170/step2_paint.png">
            </div>

            <p> In this case, 4/6 of the cases do not lead to a loss in efficiency. Also, all of these options do
                lead to openings/setup clicks/NF clicks. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but the NF-click 2 is
                arguably the best option, as it has no chance
                for efficiency loss (not sure on this one, but works for this board). Following this click in the
                replay, a 2 is revealed, and then the opening is predicted by clicking next to the wall, as it has a
                ~50% chance to be an opening. Then some NF clicks before the next step. Afterwards, another 2 setup
                click/opening predictions are taken, among the orange cells shown above.

            <h2> Step 3 </h2>
             <div class="two-img-step-box">
                <img src="images/08_19_25_170/step3_probs.png">
                <img src="images/08_19_25_170/step3_paint.png">
            </div>

            <p>In this case, half of the orange clicks lead to an efficiency loss, namely leftmost op/setup click, the
                1-2-1-op-pred, and the top right opening click, these will be discussed later.

                The L-op-pred (I NEED BETTER NAMES) leads to no progress, so the next best move would be to take the 33%
                guess, and pray for a good chord. Further, because the leftmost area is most likely an opening, the top
                left
                chord 33% is not a good choice. Between the bottom 2, the left one causes a 3bv square to be created in
                the
                potential opening space. And the one to the right causes the opening to still be there, but also hits
                the
                floating top left cell, reducing the amount of NF clicks on the board. Thus, take either of the bottom 2
                (correct me if I'm wrong).

                The replay takes the bottom right 33%, and chords around the flag, causing 2 more openings and giving
                more
                information about the board. The next chord, if accounting for floating mine density at this point
                (~20%),
                only has ~26% chance of being an inefficient chord. Then some NF clicks are taken before Step 4.

            <h2> Step 4 </h2>

             <div class="two-img-step-box">
                <img src="images/08_19_25_170/step4_probs.png">
                <img src="images/08_19_25_170/step4_paint.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                In this case, there are not many options. I would most likely die by chording the black cell, which
                offers a good chord (at least equal), and has a high probability. The other option, loses a click and
                also isn't very good for information.. The last option is the twin-chord at the bottom, which is what I
                opted to do, before taking a follow up chord.
